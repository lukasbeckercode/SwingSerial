# SwingSerial
Serial Communication for Arduino<br/>
This Software allows the user to communicate with any device that uses Serial Communication<br/>
It Lets the user chose from 7 default baud rates or enter their own, it looks for available com ports.<br/>
You can also send data to the port or receive data from the port. <br/>
I added an example File for Arduino to test the program.
